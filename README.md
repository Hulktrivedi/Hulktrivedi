# 👋 Hi there, I'm Het Trivedi

💻 Systems Thinker | Python Developer | AI/ML Explorer  
📍 Based in India | Aspiring to Build the Future of Intelligent Systems  

---

I'm a computer programmer passionate about designing solutions that work **from the ground up**—whether it's automating real-world tasks, experimenting with AI models, or architecting system-level tools like my Linux-based OS project. I’m currently working on freelance and personal projects that bridge the gap between **infrastructure, intelligence, and usability**.

🔭 **Current Interests**  
- Building a customizable Linux OS (ChimeraOS) with sandboxing and modular UI  
- Creating offline-accessible tools like a local YouTube music library  
- Exploring AI integration into everyday system-level tasks  

🛠️ **Technologies I Use**  
`Python` · `Bash` · `AI/ML (Basics)` · `OpenCV` · `MySQL` · `HTML` · `Linux (Ubuntu)`
